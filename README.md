# floating_bridge_inhomogeneous_skew_winds

Full implementation in Python of a simplified finite element model and wind response analysis of a floating bridge, including:
  All wind loads models, described in the PhD thesis "Bridge aerodynamics in skew winds: Generalized buffeting load modelling and response analysis".
  Frequency-domain and time-domain analyses.
  All response post-processing, in tables and plots.
  A long-term inhomogeneous wind analysis, from WRF data.
